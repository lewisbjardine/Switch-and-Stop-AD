TITLE: Fix: modal auto-trigger crash + prevent automatic taper generation on load

---

## Summary

This Pull Request fixes a critical issue where the app loaded directly onto the “Stopping → Sertraline 25 mg” screen and automatically triggered the taper modal before event handlers were registered. This resulted in:

- The modal overlay appearing immediately on page load  
- The modal being impossible to close  
- The entire app appearing frozen / crashed  

### ✔ What caused the bug

The stopping page initialised its drug & dose dropdowns and then inadvertently caused generateStopPlan() to run *before* the user clicked the button.  
Because Sertraline is the first item in the sorted list, its dose dropdown defaulted to 25 mg, which made the stopping logic execute automatically.

### ✔ Fix included in this PR

1. Added a guard (`window.__userInitiatedTaper__`) so the modal only opens when the **user presses Generate**.
2. Modal is now completely disabled on initial page load.
3. Cleaned out any automatic triggering during DOMContentLoaded.
4. Ensured modal buttons always have active event handlers before modal can appear.
5. Cleaned start-up state: no taper loads until the user explicitly requests one.

### ✔ Result

- The modal no longer launches automatically  
- The page loads cleanly  
- The user must click “Generate taper” before anything is produced  
- Modal can always be closed normally
